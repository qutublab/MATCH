       "Administering CPR (Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation) can save a person's life if they've stopped breathing or their heart has stopped. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to perform adult CPR:\n",
       "\n",
       "**Before you start:**\n",
       "- Ensure the scene is safe.\n",
       "- Check if the person is responsive by gently shaking their shoulder and shouting, \"Are you okay?\"\n",
       "- Call emergency services immediately or ask someone else to do so.\n",
       "- If you're alone and the person is unresponsive, perform CPR for about 2 minutes before calling emergency services.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Steps for adult CPR:**\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Check for responsiveness and breathing:**\n",
       "   - Gently tap the person and shout, \"Are you okay?\"\n",
       "   - Look for normal breathing (not gasping) for no more than 10 seconds.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Call for help:**\n",
       "   - If unresponsive and not breathing normally, call emergency services or have someone do it.\n",
       "   - If possible, get an Automated External Defibrillator (AED).\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Start chest compressions:**\n",
       "   - Kneel beside the person's chest.\n",
       "   - Place the heel of one hand on the center of the chest (lower half of the breastbone).\n",
       "   - Place your other hand on top, interlocking your fingers.\n",
       "   - Keep your arms straight and shoulders directly over your hands.\n",
       "   - Push hard and fast:\n",
       "     - Compress the chest at least 2 inches (5 cm) deep.\n",
       "     - Use a rate of at least 100 to 120 compressions per minute (like the beat of the song \"Staying Alive\").\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Deliver rescue breaths (if trained and comfortable):**\n",
       "   - After 30 compressions, give 2 rescue breaths.\n",
       "   - Tilt the person's head back slightly to open the airway.\n",
       "   - Pinch the nose shut, cover their mouth with yours, and blow to make the chest rise.\n",
       "   - Each breath should last about 1 second, and the chest should rise visibly.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. **Continue cycles:**\n",
       "   - Keep performing cycles of 30 compressions and 2 breaths.\n",
       "   - Do not stop unless:\n",
       "     - Someone with more advanced training takes over.\n",
       "     - The person shows signs of life.\n",
       "     - You are too exhausted to continue.\n",
       "     - The scene becomes unsafe.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Using an AED:**\n",
       "- Turn on the AED and follow its voice prompts.\n",
       "- Attach pads to the person's bare chest as indicated.\n",
       "- Ensure no one is touching the person during rhythm analysis and shock delivery.\n",
       "- Follow AED instructions.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Important notes:**\n",
       "- Hands-only CPR (just chest compressions) is recommended if you're not trained or uncomfortable giving rescue breaths.\n",
       "- Early defibrillation greatly improves survival chances.\n",
       "\n",
       "If you're interested in detailed training, consider taking a certified CPR course from organizations like the American Heart Association or Red Cross.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Remember:** Acting quickly and confidently can make a critical difference in saving a life."

       "  • Source & scaffold: an unusual non-ribosomal depsipeptide discovered from an “uncultured” soil bacterium (Eleftheria terrae) using the iChip technology.  \n",
       "  • Mechanism: binds lipid II and lipid III precursors in the Gram-positive cell wall pathway—so far no resistant mutants have been raised in the lab.  \n",

       "    – Potent in vivo efficacy against MRSA, VRE and drug-resistant Mycobacteria  \n",
       "    – Novel scaffold for synthetic/semisynthetic optimization  \n",
       "    – Demonstrates that the uncultured majority of soil bacteria remain a rich reservoir of new chemistry  \n",

       "  • Source & scaffold: a ribosomally-synthesized and post-translationally modified heptapeptide (RiPP) from the nematode-symbiont Photorhabdus.  \n",
       "  • Mechanism: binds BamA, the essential outer-membrane protein-assembly factor in Gram-negatives, blocking membrane biogenesis.  \n",
       "  • Why investigate?  \n",
       "    – Potent, narrow-nanomolar activity vs. E. coli, Klebsiella, Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter  \n",
       "    – Low cytotoxicity, good pharmacokinetics and in vivo protection in mouse septicemia models  \n",
       "    – Novel outer-membrane target with no cross-resistance to existing Gram-negative drugs  \n",
       "\n",
       "3. Pseudouridimycin (PUM)  \n",
       "  • Source & scaffold: a nucleoside-analog natural product from Streptomyces spp.  \n",

       "  • Why investigate?  \n",
       "    – Broad-spectrum Gram-positive activity (and potential for Gram-negative analogs with improved uptake)  \n",
